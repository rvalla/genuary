# genuary

Here I share some of the work I did to be part of [genuary](htps://genuary.art). I was part of #genuary2021
community but I will try to get more involved since 2022. This time I will share a website with

## some good results

### Tribute to Mondrian

A little collaborative homage to the famous dutch painter [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian).
A game was used to collect a set of *Mondrian's strips* which were blended in a canvas using *Interferative* tool from
[pixelative](https://gitlab.com/azarte/pixelative). These work was inspired by January 9th prompt:
*Interference patterns*. You can see the results or make your own strips
[here](https://azarte.gitlab.io/eng/metamondrian.html).

### Dice lines

The prompt for January 7th was: *generate some rules, then follow them by hand on paper*. I proposed this algorithm:

-2 Take a sheet of paper and a pencil.  
-1 Draw a point in the middle.  
0 Roll two dice.  
1 The one closest to the sheet decides the direction.  
2 The other the length of the line.  
3 Go back to 0 until you get off the sheet.  

You can follow the rules by hand or use the [computer](https://azarte.gitlab.io/scripts/dicelines.html).

## standing upon the shoulders of giants

This little project is possible thanks to a lot of work done by others in the *open-source* community. Particularly in
this case I need to mention:

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): the programming language I used.  
- [**p5js**](https://p5js.org/): the javascript version of [**Processing**](https://processing.org).
