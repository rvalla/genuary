# genuary

Here I share some of the work I did to be part of [genuary](htps://genuary.art). I did some things during
**#genuary2021** but I will try to get more involved since 2022. This time I will share a website with some of the
results (I can't say all results will be there for sure).  
The idea of **#genuary** is to have fun, learn a think about doing art while building code. You can use everything
here to work in your own ideas. In 2022 [**azarte_bot**](https://t.me/azarte_bot) will be part of my **#genuary**
participation. So, if you don't have time, don't want to code or don't know how to do it, chat with **azarte_bot**
and be part of **#genuary**.  

## repository structure

All website's material is in *public* folder. The *code* folder contains all the work I did inspired by **#genueary**'s prompts.  

## azarte_bot

I decided that **@azarte_bot** will be always part of **#genuary**. It is a telegram bot to play with randomness
artistically but directly in a chat. You can reach it [here](https://t.me/azarte_bot)
and send it the */genuary* command.  

## standing upon the shoulders of giants

This little project is possible thanks to a lot of work done by others in the *open-source* community. Particularly in
this case I need to mention:

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): the programming language I used.  
- [**p5js**](https://p5js.org/): the javascript version of [**Processing**](https://processing.org).
