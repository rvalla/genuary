# Genuary 2022

Here is the code of all my work related to #genuary2022 prompts...  

## prompts

You will a list of *gen_n.py* files with *n* the corresponding #genuary day. You can see how to instantiate
each class in *ex_trigger.py* file. Or simply run it to build one piece for each solved day.  
There are some other *classes*, necessary for build certain pieces. You can use them in a more free way.

- **DCanvas()**: a *Python Pillow* canvas to draw with *PIL.ImageDraw()* methods.  
- **NCanvas()**: a canvas to paint pixels directly.  
- **GenUtil()**: a class with some functions I use in several prompts.  
- **GenColor()**: a special class to control color behavior.  
- **GenPixel()**: a representation of a pixel which can be infected by a virus.  
- **GenVirus()**: the virus which infects *GenPixel()* instances.  
- **GenPendulum()**: a class to simulate the movement of a pendulum.
